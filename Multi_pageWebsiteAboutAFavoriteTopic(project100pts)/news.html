    		        <p>The 26-year-old quarterback is visiting with a neurologist this week to determine the severity of his concussion. 
    		        Tagovailoa "feels fine"  nearly a couple weeks removed from his concussion in 
    		        Week 2 against the Buffalo Bills, per ESPN. 
    		        Tagovailoa's health is critical to the Dolphins' future, obviously. In games Tagovailoa starts and finishes, 
    		        the Dolphins under Mike McDaniel are 20-11. In games the quarterback misses or leaves early, they're just 1-7. </p>

    		        <p>This sort of NFL season is an analyst's nightmare. Why? Because nobody who's good stays good for longer than a week, and nobody who's supposed to be good is actually good 
    		        (besides the Bills and Chiefs, but that's super boring). My job is to explain what's going on, and my editors insisted that I didn't just submit several thousand shrug emojis and call it a day. 
    		        So I'm looking at the early-season performance of three veteran-ish quarterbacks -- Pittsburgh's Justin Fields, 
    		        Minnesota's Sam Darnold and Carolina's Andy Dalton
    		        -- and trying to figure out what led to their (relatively) hot starts. And far more importantly, will their success continue?</p>

    		        <p>Coach Mike McDaniel said he's happy with where Tyler Huntley is at in terms 
    		        of learning the playbook. 
    		        He emphasized that with QBs 
    		        "you want to make sure that you're doing right by them" 
    		        when they actually see the field.</p>
